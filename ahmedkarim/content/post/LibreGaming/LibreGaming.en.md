## Intro
LibreGaming Is a program for installing gaming required packages on Linux.

It works by identifying you Linux distribution and based on that info it installs the right packages for you.
Currently supported distributions:

* Ubuntu, of course.
* Arch Linux, because I use Arch btw.
* Fedora.
* And finally OpenSUSE Tumbleweed.

The tool also should work on the above distributions derivatives too.
## Lets talk features:

The tool is a great starting point when you have just made a clean install. No need to waste half an hour just to play games.

LibreGaming will install these packages for you:

1. Steam.
2. Wine-staging.
3. Gamemode.
4. ProtonGE, using protonup.
5. Lutris Launcher.
6. Heroic Launcher.
7. MangoHud and Goverlay.
8. itch.io Launcher.
9. Athenaeum Launcher.
10. Steam Tinker Launch.

## Installation:

There are two options to install LibreGaming.

You can install LibreGaming using pip3. For example,```pip3 install libregaming```.

Or you can clone the GitHub repo and install it.

Moving on to Usage:

LibreGaming is very easy to use, you tailor most if not all the packages you need to install and exclude all the ones that you don‚Äôt use, this way it‚Äôs guaranteed a minimal install.
```
    libregaming -h
```
Is what you need to run to display all the available options.

The list of options are plenty and it will take up most on this article to cover, so I am skipping it. However, for more details I have provided the link to LibreGaming GitHub Page.
