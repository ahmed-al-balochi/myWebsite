## Intro
LibreGaming Is a program for installing gaming required packages on Linux.

It works by identifying you Linux distribution and based on that info it installs the right packages for you.
Currently supported distributions:

* Ubuntu, of course.
* Arch Linux, because I use Arch btw.
* Fedora.
* And finally OpenSUSE Tumbleweed.

The tool also should work on the above distributions derivatives too.
## Lets talk features:

The tool is a great starting point when you have just made a clean install. No need to waste half an hour just to play games.

LibreGaming will install these packages for you:

1. Steam.
2. Wine-staging.
3. Gamemode.
4. ProtonGE, using protonup.
5. Lutris Launcher.
6. Heroic Launcher.
7. MangoHud and Goverlay.
8. itch.io Launcher.
9. Athenaeum Launcher.
10. Steam Tinker Launch.
