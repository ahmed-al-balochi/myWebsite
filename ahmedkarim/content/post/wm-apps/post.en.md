##  Intro
These are my favorite Window manager(WM) utilities. They will help you switch from the traditional Desktop Environments(DE).

So, without further a due let's begin.

##  Terminal
I know it's a no-brainer, but a terminal is a key component of a WM setup. So, a great Terminal means a great Window manager session.

Great GNU/Linux Terminals:
- Alacritty. My favorite Terminal Emulator 
- Kitty.
- Terminator.
- Konsole.
- Gnome Terminal.

### Installation
For Debian/Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install <Terminal name>
```
For Arch Linux
```
sudo pacman -S <Terminal name>
```

##  Xrandr/Arandr
Xrandr for those who don't know is a Terminal based program that sets up your monitor/s. However, you don't need to use it in order to set up your monitors if you don't like Terminal based tools. This is where Arandr comes in its a GUI front end for Xrandr, it has a great feature that when you configured your monitor/s correctly you can export the configuration as a script. This is great, this means that you can include it in your WM autostart script and it automatically sets your monitor/s correctly like if you were running a DE.
* Note: arandr requires xrandr, so you can install both by installing arandr.

### Installation
For Debian/Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install arandr
```
For Arch Linux
```
sudo pacman -S arandr
```

##  Rofi/Dmenu
Both Rofi and Dmenu are great replacements for the DE launcher and application's menu.
Both applications do the same thing, and both also have many features that if you use them to their fullest you will always prefer them over the DE launcher and menu.

### Installation
For Debian/Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install rofi
sudo apt install dmenu
```
For Arch Linux
```
sudo pacman -S rofi
sudo pacman -S dmenu
```

##  Nitrogen
It's a great minimal wallpaper setter for GNU/Linux Operating System. it's fast, lightweight, no-frills application. 

### Installation
For Debian/Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install nitrogen
```
For Arch Linux
```
sudo pacman -S nitrogen
```

##  Picom
Picom or formally known as Compton. is a compositor for your WM, its a fancy way of saying it handles all visual-related things in your session. For example, you can configure it to have shadows around your windows or have a blur effect on specific applications like a terminal. 

### Installation
For Debian/Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install picom
```
For Arch Linux
```
sudo pacman -S picom
```

##  Conclution
I hope you found these applications useful and I would love to hear your feedback on your favorite WM applications?
