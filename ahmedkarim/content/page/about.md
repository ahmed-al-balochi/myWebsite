# About Me 
I am currently undergoing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Riphah International University.
Ever since the first computer I built with my brother, I knew Tech is what I am most passionate about. I started my journey learning basic web development, then after I finished that I wanted to take it to the next level by enrolling in a Computer Science degree. 
I am still on the path to learn more, and I hope that I am doing a great job at teaching you new things.
